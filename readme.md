*Editor, 2022: How far I've come. This is a great project but the code sure does look amateurish now.*

Groups discrete data events into directional trajectories in a 3-D hexagonal space.
Based on Neutron Induced Fission Fragment Tracking Experiment (NIFFTE) time projection chamber data.

Much more detailed information is in tracks.ipynb. Github will natively run the file so give it a click.

Or see tracks_standalone.py for source code of a standalone python version without the iPython wrapping.
